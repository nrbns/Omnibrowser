# OmniBrowser v0.2.0-beta (Draft)

_Target release: 2025-11-30_

## Highlights
- **Navigation overhaul:** grouped top-bar commands (“View”, “Workspace”, “Tools”) for faster access to zoom, workspace, and tooling controls.
- **Improved OmniDesk launchpad:** refreshed quick-action cards with descriptive copy and a clearer “Command Center” intro.
- **Status tracking reinstated:** `PROJECT_STATUS.md` now publishes project health, blockers, and milestone targets.

## Known Issues
- **TypeScript build failures:** `npm run build:types` currently fails due to legacy type coverage gaps. Fix scheduled prior to tagging.
- **CI coverage incomplete:** lint, unit tests, and `npm audit` not yet integrated into the release pipeline.
- **UI polish still in flight:** tab split view, hibernation indicators, accessibility audit, theme switching, and enhanced error boundaries remain open.
- **Signed installers pending:** Windows (NSIS) and macOS (DMG) signing/notarization workflow is not yet in place.

## Upgrade Notes
1. Run `npm install` to pick up the latest dependency lockfile updates.
2. Execute `npm run build:types` after pulling once the type fixes land (currently failing).
3. Packaging requires a fresh `npm run build && electron-builder` once TypeScript and CI items are resolved.

## Next Steps Before Tagging
- Finalize changelog entry and confirm CI is green.
- Land the TypeScript fixes so `npm run build:types` succeeds.
- Complete Phase A UI polish tasks in the checklist.
- Add installer signing steps (document command scripts + certificate usage).
